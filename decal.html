						Ego: "Making the Next Web Revolution" is a project-based DeCal in which students work together to build a web platform. The web platform students will be a feed reader that allows users to subscribe to an interests and receive feeds from them instead of having to visit web sites individually. Students will learn how to apply what they have learned in class to a real-world project, and hone teamwork skills that are essential to being a great programmer.

				People use Internet to receive information about their interests. You visit tech-blogs like Engadget to receive information about Technology. Billboard.com for music. The problem is, we are doing this in a quite roundabout way. When people use Internet, they want to receive information about their "interest," not really some website. As such, we will develop a webapp in which users can subscribe to a particular keyword, such as "iPhone" and "Obama," and directly hear about their interests in one place instead of visiting websites individually. Ego will fetch latest information about the keyword from various websites - blogs, news, SNS, shopping mall, etc. - and update users through their news feed.

			<div class="apply_objBox">
				<div class="apply_objBoxHead">
					Application
				</div>
				<div class="apply_objBoxText">
					Students will apply what they have learned in class to a real-world application. Education is more than learning dry theory. Rather, it involves real-world applications, namely group projects like Ego.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="apply_objBox">
				<div class="apply_objBoxHead">
					Teamwork
				</div>
				<div class="apply_objBoxText">
					Students will learn how to work in a team. Coding alone and coding in a team is a vastly different experience. Coding alone is like writing an essay for only you to see it. In a group, you need to properly encapsulate your modules, adhere to the framework, etc. As a result, you will learn to become a better programmer, one who is capable of working efficiently in a team - a quality that may be more important than writing a more efficient code.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="apply_objBox">
				<div class="apply_objBoxHead">
					MVC
				</div>
				<div class="apply_objBoxText">
					Students will be introduced to MVC (Model-View-Controller) Framework. Students will use CodeIgniter PHP framework, which uses MVC architectural pattern in software engineering. In MVC framework, there will be a strict division of labor/concern in application development, namely Model(business logic), View(User Interface), and Controller (User Input). This allows the team to develop independently, test quickly, and manage more efficiently. 
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="apply_objBox">
				<div class="apply_objBoxHead">
					Source Control
				</div>
				<div class="apply_objBoxText">
					Students will be using GitHub to learn how to work with Git revision control/source code management system. GitHub allows teams to manage large amount of codes efficiently by making sure changes are orderly, keeping track of revision history, creating a set of rules for the team to follow, and managing a backup in case of emergency.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="apply_objBox">
				<div class="apply_objBoxHead">
					Development
				</div>
				<div class="apply_objBoxText">
					Students will combine various techniques, including PHP, HTML 5, CSS, jQuery, and XML to create a revolutionary feed reader. We believe this will be a valuable experience for students by participating in an effort to create something new that will help the users, rather than staying as a "user" who uses existing products.

In the discussion section, each team will talk about their progress in the goal for the week, and discuss areas of improvements in the project. We will also discuss features to implement in the given week, and talk about how we should implement them, as well as division of labor among teams, etc. In a group lab session, students will break into their teams, and will work on the goal given in a class discussion session.

					The 2-hour labshould be an opportunity for students to work on the project with other team members. Students are not expected to finish everything during the lab; instead, students will use the time to meet with his/her team members and work on the project together. Students are encouraged to meet online or offline with the team members to discuss and work on the project throughout the week. There will be weekly assignments that will require the students to implement some features of the Ego project, except the first two weeks, during which students will practice working with GitHub and CodeIgniter MVC Framework. In some weeks, there will be readings to prepare students for the following week's discussion. (ex. If we are going to implement RSS feed system by keywords, we might give a brief reading about how RSS works, as well as some intro to XML.

HTML 5, PHP, Javascript), and one to two design teams, comprised of students with strong expertise in web dsign (ex. HTML 5, CSS, Photoshop, and maybe jQuery for dynamic effects). Students will be matched with other team members of various strengths, so that students can learn from other members and utilize each other's strengths for the team's advantage. Students are expected to know at least two of: HTML 5, PHP, Javascript, and Python for Development, and HTML 5, CSS, Photoshop, and jQuery for Design Team.
